# TRAVELGEM ✈️

This project was completed using <b>html, java script, bootstrap and css</b>

This website serves as a digital representation of a fictional reputable travel agency, offering users the opportunity to book a wide array of destinations tailored to their budgetary preferences. While currently static in nature, the website holds the potential for future expansion into a dynamic platform.

Functioning as a comprehensive template, the website effectively showcases the agency's core offerings, providing customers with a seamless platform to access reviews and sample offerings from numerous resorts available for rental through the agency.
